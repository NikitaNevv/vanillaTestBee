This page is made on html/css and pure JS. I used SASS to make up styles and BEM approach in naming styles. 
All fonts are downloaded and used with @font-face. 
There is a photo slider, success popup when we send quick question, a toggle button, and success popup when we send offer. 
Also you can input offer price and see the chances appear on the screen. 
Yoo can select with select element how long the work will be and the warranty period. 
There is no adaptive layout.
